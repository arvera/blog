Upon doing some testing for some connectivity, a client college recommended to use ncat with -v, the exact command was ncat -vvv -w2 -i2 <HOST> <PORT>

I was trying to understand the results and I did something where

| hostname | comment |
| - | - |
| hosto | source environment |
| hosta | target environment |


## For a failing not open connection on port 80:
```
angelo@hosto:~$ ncat -vvv -i2 -w2 hosta 80

```
