Toady is one of those days, that I am posting as a purpose of using this blog as my notepad.

When talking about WEB APPS there are 3 main different apps types that often I have to refer to.

* MPA = **Multi Page Apps**: Your traditional static using technologies such as, but not limited to: HTML, JSP, Servlet or similar. It refers to a page by page browsing. For HCL Commerce this is what Aurora, Madison, Elite and others.

* SPA = **Singe Page Apps**: Your more updated website that uses Node.js, React.js or similar, again non-restricting list. It refers to a page deveoped for much of its parts(if not all) in  JavaScript. For HCL Commerce this refers to new Saphhire or Emerald stores.

* `null` = **Transitional Web Apps**: Refers to an hybrid, an in between approach.

I am still learning about this new concept of Transitional Web Apps, but here is a video that I friend recently posted.
