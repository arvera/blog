I a few years ago I tried to implement comments for the blog but that time there was only a few ways to do it with jekyll minimal mistakes type of blog, and I never got it working. You needed a servless app and I just got busy with other things, move forward a couple of years and features and github now supports Apps and Discussion threads (giscus.app)[https://giscus.app/]

(giscus.app)[https://giscus.app/] is small app that helps integrate Github dicussions features with blog.

Given I was running a very old version of jekyll and minimal mistakes, so I upgraded and (ba da bing ba da boom)[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ba%20da%20bing%20ba%20da%20boom]... I now have comments on the site.
