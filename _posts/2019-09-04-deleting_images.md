If you are in the world of Docker and kubernetes, at somepoint you will be faced with your registry becoming over populated with images. Which images to delete and how to mantain it is not the scope of this post. This post is about how to manually delete an image from the registry and while googling that I found this one liner, that I think works pretty well.
