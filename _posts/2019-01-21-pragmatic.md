I am a not a person to sit down and read books, in fact the only book that I can really say completed was
[Men are Mars](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00EZX49KU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=B00EZX49KU&linkCode=as2&tag=gunfus-20&linkId=1afa5fe47ec17be909f44dfb39e037c9). My entire life through university I bought books to learn, but there were always reference books, so the thick books that have everything in them and I used them and carry them everywhere to learn.

Today I stumble on this link about [thinking practically](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/four-books-that-will-turn-you-into-a-practical-thinker) and it caught my attention and then it head me.. I am a pragmatic person.
